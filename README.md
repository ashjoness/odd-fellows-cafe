# odd-fellows-cafe


Thank you for taking a look at my work! This repo includes everything i've learned so far about html and css.



This project is based on the Odd Fellows Cafe located in New Shoreham, Rhode Island - where i've done a summer working in the coffee shop. I absolutely enjoyed my time there and figured i'd use the cafe as inspiration for my landing page (with permission from the owner of course!).

All art was AI generated using ChatGPT. The art inspiration was from a mix of the games: 

 - Stardew Valley 
 - Good Coffee, Great Coffee
 - Animal Crossing

 I'd like to thank you again for taking the time look at my work.
